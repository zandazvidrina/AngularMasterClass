Me's Angular Master Class Training Book\n\nOver the last three years, Trade Me has provided Angular Master Class training to all its\ndevelopers. This is an intensive deep-dive into a full-spectrum of the Angular platform.\nThis course is essential for developers to quickly become productive with Angular development.\nAbout this AMC Coding Labs Book\nThis book contains all the lab exercises documents needed for the hands-on, coding labs.\nModules\nEach module of the Angular Master Class course has 1 or more lab exercises. Each lab exercise adds features and enhancements to the previous lab exercise.\n\nThese exercise descriptions are used by students as a guide for each exercise.\n\nShown below are quick-links and ordering of the courseware Modules:\n\nModule 1: Jump-Start\nModule 2: RxJS\nModule 3: Forms\nModule 4: Routing\nModule 5: NgRx\nModule 6: Architecture\n\nFor each lab exercise, simply open there exercise-- markdown associated with that exercise.\n\nWeb and App Servers\nTo launch your web application, use a Terminal session with the command:\n$ ng serve\nThis starts a web server for the Angular 7.x application; open with a browser url http://localhost:4200.\nAnd since your Angular application may request external, remote data [from http://localhost:4201/api], you will need a local app server to respond to the REST API calls. We have already configured a server as part of this repository.\nSimply start a second, separate Terminal session with the commend:\n$ npm run rest-api\n\n\nImportant Message\nRemember: never be afraid to ask questions! The Trade Me trainers love questions.\n\nOften your question - and the answers - are very important to other students in the class.\n\nAnd finally, help each other.

Let's implement some routing features. In this exercise we're going to route to components.\nScenario\nIn order to route from our contacts list to a contact detail page, the first thing we need to do is to extract the current contacts list implementation into its own component, so that ContactsAppComponent is just a \"frame\" that holds our app, consisting of multiple components, together.\nWe can create a new component ContactsListComponent using angular-cli by running:\n$ ng generate component contacts-list --project=amc-starter -m=app\n\nOr the shorter version:\n$ ng g c contacts-list -m=app\n\nUsing the -m, we specify the module this component will belong to. This will make sure the component is added to the declarations section of this module and you don't have to do this yourself. \nNote that in most scenario's, this step is unnecesary. The angular-cli will try to find the closest module to add this component to. Since in this case it will find two modules (contacts-material and app) at the same level in the directory hierarchy, we do need to specify it.\n\nBonus: which command line argument do you use to run the command in test/dry mode?\n\nTasks\n\nCreate a component ContactsListComponent with the Angular CLI and move the current contact list logic there from ContactsAppComponent\nCreate src/app/app.routes.ts, import the ContactsListComponent and export an array with routes (e.g. export const APP_ROUTES = [...]), holding one route pointing to ContactsListComponent.\nIn app.module.ts import RouterModule from @angular/router and APP_ROUTES from ./app/app.routes\nAdd RouterModule.forRoot(APP_ROUTES) to the imports array of the module\nAdd  in ContactsAppComponent's view to load and render components\n\nBonus Tasks\n\nFigure out how to create a route that redirects to / when none of the configured routes are matched by the router.\n\nCode Snippets\ncontacts-list.component.ts\nFigure: j51\napp.routes.ts\nFigure: j52\nAdditional resources and help\n\nRouting in Angular revisited\nRouter Guide\nRouterOutlet\n\nNext Lab\nGo to JumpStart - Lab #6\n"},"exercises/jump-start-tutorial/exercise-6_using-routeparams.html":{"url":"exercises/jump-start-tutorial/exercise-6_using-routeparams.html","title":"Using RouteParams","keywords":"","body":"Exercise: Accessing Route Parameters\nNext up, we want to route to a contact detail page.\nIn this exercise we're going to create a new component that is able to retrieve routing parameters.\nScenario\nThe contacts app should be extended with a contact detail page.

We now want to take it one step further and fetch this data from a server using Angular's Http layer.\nIn order to make http work, we need to configure our application's dependency injector and teach it some http capabilities. Just like for the router, Angular provides a module HttpClientModule that we have to import from @angular/common/http.\nWe also need to import operators for the Reactive Extensions.

Namely, out of order responses.\nConsider the following:\nThe user enters Christoph, pauses, clears the search box, and enters Pascal. The application issues two search requests, one for Christoph and one for Pascal.\nA load balancer could dispatch the requests to two different servers with different response times. This means, we can't be sure which of the requests will come back first or second. The results from the first Christoph request might arrive after the later Pascal results. The user will be confused if we display the Christoph results to the Pascal query.\nIn order to fix that problem we have to combine the Observable of terms with the Observable of API response using the switchMap operator. The switchMap will take care of unsubscribing from Observable API responses as soon as new requests are issued. By combining the input stream (what the user types) with the output stream (what the server responds) through the switchMap operator we get a new, more sophisticated Observable that only yields the results that we are interested in.\nScenario\nIn src/app/contacts-list/contacts-list.component.ts in the ngOnInit method, combine the Observable of terms (Observable) and the Observable of API responses (Observable>) by using the switchMap operator. Expose the new Observable to this.contacts. This will prevent out of order responses to mess with the UI.\nThere's one more catch though. So far we've used this.contacts = this.contactsService.getContacts() in ngOnInit to show the initial list of contacts. Clearly, if we just follow what we explained above we end up overwriting the value of this.contacts and end up with a list that's initially empty.\nFortunately we can simply use the merge static method to merge in this.contactsService.getContacts() to display the initial list of contacts.\nTasks\n\nImport switchMap just as we did with the other operators\nImport merge from rxjs\nIn ngOnInit use switchMap operator to combine the stream of terms with the search method producing an Observable>\nMerge the stream with the Observable returned by this.contactsService.getContacts() for the initial state of the list\nRemove the obsolete search(term: string) method from the component\n\nCode Snippets\ncontacts-list.component.ts\n \nBonus Tasks\n\nSimulate that the initial loading of contacts takes 5000ms (e.g. contactsService.getContacts().pipe(delay(5000))). \nThis causes search results to get overwritten by the full list when performing a search quickly after the application  starts.

Currently, our logic requires the list of contacts to be loaded when navigating to the details page. In fact, ContactsDetailComponent retrieves the selected contact to show its details in the HTML template of the component.\nOne way to fix this problem is to implement a router guard which will \"protect\" a specific part of our application. Guards can re-route and multiple guards can protect a single route.\nWith a router guard we can make sure that the contact is loaded before we navigate and show the contact's details. Note that in contrast to ContactsListComponent were we would fetch all contacts, ContactsDetailComponent loads one (1) specific contact.\n\nYou might wonder why we are using a guard instead of a resolver. The reason being is that we are not interested in the data returned by a resolver because all of our application state is stored in a single immutable state tree (Store). As such a guard makes more sense for this scenario.\n\nScenario\nLet's refactor our contacts application and allow deep linking by implementing a ContactExistsGuard. Use the UML sequence diagram below to help with your code challenge in this lab:\nFigure: ngrx_contactdetail_router_guard\nTasks\n\nCreate a new action type for ADD_CONTACT and add it to the ContactsActionTypes in contacts.actions.ts.\n\nImplement AddContactAction and use the previously created action type.\n\nMake sure the payload of the action class is of type Contact.\n\nDon't forget to add AddContactAction to the union type ContactsActions that is used inside the ContactsReducer.\n\n\n\nUpdate contacts-reducer.ts to handle storing a single contact using the action type ADD_CONTACT:\n\nFirst, check whether the contact is in the list. Tip: You can use Array.find.  \n\nIf the contact is already in the list, do nothing and return a new array containing all contacts.\n\nIf the contact was not found, extend the list of contacts and add the new contact to the list.\nTip: You can use the spread operator for array literals. Example: [...myCollection, myItem].\nThis creates a new list with all the items from myCollection plus an additional item myItem. If the contact was found, we don't have to do anything and we can return the list unmodified.\n\nAdd a new property loaded to the ContactState interface. This is used to determine if the list was already loaded. The type will be boolean and the inital value should be false. Set this property to true when LoadContactsSuccessAction was dispatched.\n\n\n\nCreate a ContactExistsGuard in /src/app/contact-exists.guard.ts and implement the CanActivate interface. You can do that using the Angular CLI: ng g g contact-exists -m app:\n\nIn the canActivate() method, dispatch SelectContactAction and give it the contact id from the ActivatedRouteSnapshot using route.paramMap.get('id').\n\nSelect loaded from the store in order to check whether the list was already fetched. Make sure to\nchain take(1) to your stream which returns a specified number of contiguous events. In this case\nwe are only interested in the loaded property once.\n\nRemember that store.pipe(select()) returns an observable.\n\n\nUse switchMap to map to an inner observable which will be the results of this.contactsService.getContact(contactId).\n\nIf you are calling getContact make sure to dispatch AddContactAction once the http call has been resolved.\n\nMap the inner observable to a boolean using .map(contact => !!contact).\n\nThis is necessary because the canActivate functions returns either a boolean, Promise\nor Observable.\n\n\n\n\nAdd ContactExistsGuard provider to the providers array of the ContactsModule in app.module.ts to make the guard available in your app. If you used the Angular CLI this should have been taken care of already.

That's unfortunate because it's not really maintainable, DRY and therefore not reusable if components share common selectors.\nWith ngrx > 4.x we can leverage efficient selector composition using the createSelector function. As a result, a selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments change. This practice is known as memoization. In addition, selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.\n\nA selector in its raw form is just a function that takes the application state and returns a value (e.g. contact). Used with ngrx Store, selectors are queries that return observables to values.\n\nIn addition, we want to optimize the data structure of our Store by using the Entity Pattern. This allows us to perform fast CRUD operations and simplify our reducers.\nScenario\nIn this lab, we want to extract all of our selectors from the components into contacts.reducer.ts and compose them into a single query ContactsQuery to make them reusable, easier to maintain, and reduce components' responsibility.

When the async work completes, the Effect will internally dispatch sync actions to update the store, e.g. UpdateContactSuccessAction.\n\nUnlike Redux, the async and sync actions [in ngrx] are still PJO(s) or class instances. The object/instances with specific action types will be directed to the Effect that has registered to listen to that action type.\n\nUse the following diagram to refactor your application with the ngrx @Effect() decorator by the example of loading the list of contacts.

Here, it makes sense to use contactMap over switchMap because we don't want to cancel previous update requests but rather wait for them to finish before another update action is sent.\nIt is important to note that the updateContact$ effect not only saves the contact it also actually routes to the contact details view.

They consume business services depend on routing and more.\nThere's nothing wrong about this category of components. However, these components are often not really reusable. What if we would like to display contact details somewhere else in our app? Maybe embedded in another view with a different URL? That's not possible with it's current design.\nIn this exercise we want to learn how to refactor our component into:\n\na Presentation Component that strictly communicates via inputs and outputs\na View Component that embeds and controls the Presentation Component\n\nFigure: architecture-step-1\nScenario\nLet's refactor our ContactsDetailComponent into two components:\n\na ContactsDetailComponent is dumb presentation view; dumb in the sense that it doesn't know about any routing concerns or the ContactsService\na ContactsDetailViewComponent is the view component which does know about the ContactsService and RouteParams but doesn't know how to display a contact.\n\nBy separating these two concerns (reusable renderer and specific view component) we get to an application architecture that embraces reusability with only a slight increase in complexity.\n  $ ng generate component contacts-detail-view -m app # or ng g c contacts-detail-view -m app\n\nThe -m app is a long-hand version for --module app.module.ts. That said, if you stick to the convention of naming your module files .module.ts. If you deviate from this naming convention you have to specify the entire filename, e.g. if you name your module file app.feature.module.ts you would have to pass the entire filename to the Angular CLI command: ng g c contacts-detail-view -m app.feature.module.ts.\n\nTasks\n\nCreate the navigateToEditor and navigateToList methods which use the router#navigate(dsl) API to route to different Components; note that these are methods of the ContactsDetailViewComponent class.\nRefactor the ContactDetailComponent to a Presentation component:\nMove the code that handles the RouteParams from the ContactDetailsComponent to the ContactsDetailViewComponent and expose the contact as a contact property\nRemove all routing concerns from the ContactDetailComponent\nImport EventEmitter and Output into the ContactDetailComponent and emit edit and back events for the button clicks\nImport Input and decorate the contact property as such\nKeep in mind that the buttons in the template are no longer anchors with links, but buttons with click handlers\n\n\n\nCode Snippets\ncontacts-details-view.component.ts\nFigure: a1\ncontacts-detail.component.ts\nFigure: a2\nWeb and App Servers\nTo launch your web application, use a Terminal session with the command  ng serve.
