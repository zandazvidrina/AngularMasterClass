# Angular Master Class

This repository contains all the **Exercise Descriptions** for the Angular Master Class courseware.

## Modules

Each module of the **Angular Master Class** course has 1 or more lab exercises. Each lab exercise adds features and enhancements to the previous lab exercise.

> These exercise descriptions are used by **students** as a guide for each exercise.

Shown below are quick-links and ordering of the courseware Modules:

* Module 1: **[Jump-Start](jump-start-tutorial/README.md)**
* Module 2: **[RxJS](rxjs/README.md)**
* Module 3: **[Forms](forms/README.md)**
* Module 4: **[Routing](routing/README.md)**
* Module 5: **[NgRx](ngrx/README.md)**
* Module 6: **[Architecture](architecture/README.md)**

For each lab exercise, simply open there `exercise-<xxx>-<xxx>` markdown associated with that exercise.

## Web and App Servers

To launch your web application, use a Terminal session with the command:

```
$ ng serve
```

This starts a web server for the Angular 7 application; open with a browser url `http://localhost:4200`.

And since your Angular application may request external, remote data [from `http://localhost:4201/api`], you will need a local app server to respond to the REST API calls. We have already configured a server as part of this repository.

Simply start a second, separate Terminal session with the commend:

```
$ npm run rest-api
```

## Important Message

Remember: never be afraid to ask questions! The **Trade Me** trainers love questions.

> Often your question - and the answers - are very important to other students in the class.

And finally, help each other. Helping other students will reinforce the ideas that you are learning in this lesson... Have fun and good luck!
